# EasyGas_SLIIT_MADProject

Sri Lanka has faced a severe economic disaster, leading to long lines for fuel, lack of basic necessities, and long queues for cooking gas. Waiting in lines for cooking gas can be time-wasting, so it is important to use this mobile application.
Our objective of this app is people will be able to reserve an appointment to pick their gas. Both shop owners and gas buyers can sign into the app separately. Shop owners can register their shops first. Then they can add a date, time slots for the respective date and the gas count which planned to sell during that specific time slot. So, the as buyers can register to the app buy giving the information which are asked. Also, they will be able to pick a nearby shop from the map, make the order and suitable slot accordingly. When the order is confirmed, buyer will get a QR code which has its order details. We have included a map to display gas shops to the buyer.
We can mention user-friendly and responsive interfaces, push notifications that can be targeted to each user, and a feedback system to get customers’ reviews, feedback, and suggestions as some of the main features of this app.
For the development of this project, we are using the Kotlin programming language along with Android Studio and Firebase as the database.
